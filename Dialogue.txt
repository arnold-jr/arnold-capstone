Hi, my name is Joshua Arnold. I earned my PhD in Environmental 
Engineering at Vanderbilt University, and I recently completed a 
Post-doctoral appointment at the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology. For my Capstone project, I've developed a web application 
called AmeniDC.

AmeniDC allows users to quickly visualize relationships between
the sale price of a residential home and the amenities that are near
to it, using an interactive map divided up by zipcode. 


By querying the OpenData.DC API,
I've extracted property data containing the location and price of every 
property sale in the District over the last six years. 

I've then  searched within a 1000 meter radius 
for nearby amenities using the Google Places API. 


Although the floor area of a home is a good predictor, this data was
not available to me. Landarea is likely a decent proxy for floor area,
but this is generally not known by a prospective buyer.

Using this data alone, I can construct
useful map layers which give summaries 
of the number and type of amenities within a particular neighborhood, 
but utlimately, 
the goal is to find hidden 
gems within the District, that is, 
areas with a high number of amenities relative to the price. 

To do this, I'vee constructed a regression model 
which attempts to explain cost in terms of a number of factors 
such as location and lot size. 
For location, I fit the data using the KNearestNeighbors regressor, 
whereas I expect lotsize to vary linearly with the cost. 
The next step is to constructe linear regressor on the residuals 
to capture the relationship
between number and type of amenit
providing prospective home buyers the tools to determine the 
home location that best suits their needs.ies.

88% of the household of Washington, DC don't own a car,
so living near to amenities 
such as grocery stores, metro stations, and parks
is at a premium within the District.
