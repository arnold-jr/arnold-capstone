Hi, I'm Joshua Arnold, and I've developed a web app called AmeniDC.

88% of the household of Washington, DC don't own a car,
so living near to amenities 
such as grocery stores, metro stations, and parks
is at a premium within the District.
The app AmeniDC aims to quantify just what that premium is, 
allowing users to 
quickly visualize relationships 
between proximitity to amenities 
and the cost of owning a private residence.

By querying the OpenData.DC API,
I've extracted property data containing the location and price of every 
property sale in the District over the last six years. 

I've then  searched within a 1000 meter radius 
for nearby amenities using the Google Places API. 

Using this data alone, I can construct
useful map layers which give summaries 
of the number and type of amenities within a particular neighborhood, 
but utlimately, 
the goal is to find hidden 
gems within the District, that is, 
areas with a high number of amenities relative to the price. 

To do this, I'vee constructed a regression model 
which attempts to explain cost in terms of a number of factors 
such as location and lot size. 
For location, I fit the data using the KNearestNeighbors regressor, 
whereas I expect lotsize to vary linearly with the cost. 
The next step is to constructe linear regressor on the residuals 
to capture the relationship
between number and type of amenities.
